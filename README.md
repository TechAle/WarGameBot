# WarGameXp
This is a simple bot that makes xp by making fights to another bot.
## Why?
I wanted to get multi-attack, but it's locked at level 38, and I'm too lazy to make it manually.<br>
So I made this bot to do it for me.
## How to use?
1. Install Python 3.8 or higher.
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the bot: `python main.py`
4. Enjoy
## How it works?
It's simple. The bot makes a fight to another bot, and then it waits for the fight to end.<br>
When the fight ends, it makes another fight, and so on.<br>
It also makes a fight when the bot is started.
## How to configure?
You just need to add 2 emails and 2 passwords to `accounts.json`.<br>
